# game_of_life_rs

### John Conway's famous 'Game of Life' cellular automaton simulated in Rust through the print function.

I wrote most of this with additional general help from [this guide](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/rules.html). 

I'd like to add a GUI that would display the automaton at a higher FPS with the ability to set your own 'seed' before running it.
